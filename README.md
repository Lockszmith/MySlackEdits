# MySlackEdits
My SlackEdit markdown workspace.

Public documentation I either plan to share with the world (for example: Stack Overflow Q&As, or some GitHub discussions).

I was never a blog write

Starting without folders, if I find myself actually working with this more, I'll probably start using a folder structure - either based on topic or 'publishing destination'.
