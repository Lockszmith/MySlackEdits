# MySlackEdits
My [SlackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app#providerId=githubWorkspace&owner=Lockszmith&repo=MySlackEdits&branch=main) markdown workspace.

Public documentation I either plan to share with the world (for example: Stack Overflow Q&As, or some GitHub discussions) or just non-private thoughts.

I was never a blog writer, never thought anyone would want reading excursions into my brain - whether likeminded nerds like me, colleagues or friends.
But also, never considered my thoughts to be private - as in "they shouldn't be shared". So, I'm going to do this musing 'in the open', here.
I really like the idea of having `git` as the backend, as I tend to change things quite a lot, and this might provide me (or someone else in the future) some insight to the way I think/work.

Starting without folders, if I find myself actually working with this more, I'll probably start using a folder structure - either based on topic or 'publishing destination'.

Let's see where this takes me.
